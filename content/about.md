Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Ramon van Sprundel, a recent graduate living in Zeeland, The Netherlands my whole life. 

I'm a software engineer. Currently jobless, so I might as well contribute to open-source projects ðŸ§™. I've set up this blog to write about my findings and personal experiences as a software developer, it's also a way to use the time I have in-between studying and finding a job.

Found a typo or error in my blog? Great! You can create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/van-sprundel/personal-blog). Thanks in advance!
