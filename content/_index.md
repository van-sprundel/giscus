# Ramon van Sprundel

Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Ramon, a recent CS graduate from The Netherlands.

As a junior software engineer currently between jobs, Iâ€™m using this time to contribute to open-source projects ðŸ§™. Iâ€™ve created this blog to share my personal experiences and discoveries. It also helps me stay productive in-between job hunts.

Found a typo or error in my blog? Great! You can create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/van-sprundel/personal-blog). Thanks in advance!

Also, feel free to contact me at ramonvansprundel (at) gmail (dot) com
