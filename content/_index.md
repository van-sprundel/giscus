# Welcome!

Welcome to my blog. Iâ€™m Ramon, a systems programmer based in The Netherlands. 

I graduated in July 2024 from Avans University of Applied Sciences with a degree in Computer Science.

As of November 2024, I work at [Teifi Digital](https://teifi.ca) as a Fullstack Developer. In my free time I like try to contribute to open-source projects.

If you notice a typo or error, please report it by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/van-sprundel/personal-blog/issues). Thank you.
